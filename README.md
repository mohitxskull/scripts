# Scripts by skull

This repository contains a collection of scripts that I use on a daily basis. I have tried to make them as simple as possible, so that they can be easily understood and modified.

## Scripts

### `git.sh`

This script will help you with github cmds.

It will help you with the following commands:

- initialize a new repository.
- push changes to the remote.
- update and push changes to the remote.
- force push changes to the remote.
- resolve conflicts.

Resolve conflicts options:
- Keep the version in the current branch.
- Keep the version in the remote branch.
- Keep both versions and create a new commit.
- Discard both versions and start over.

It has easy to use menus and will clear the terminal screen after each step.
